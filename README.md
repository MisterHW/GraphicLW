# GraphicLW
GraphicLW is an image manipulation tool written in Delphi. It's an old project which never got finished. Fun times though.

Things I mainly did with it:

* geometric transformations (esp. panoramic images, realtime updated lens correction)
* mask operations
* batch processing
* local histogram correction
* vector data editing for image segmentation
* getting image data via TWAIN (works with a surprising number of devices)
